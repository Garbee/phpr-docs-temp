<p>Common settings are global settings that allow you to manage core functions of your site. For example, how to represent dates. An explanation of the settings are found below.</p>
<p>You can set your site's locality under System &gt; Settings &gt; Common Settings.</p>
<h3>Locale Setting</h3>
<p>Localization manages areas of location and language in all environments, it controls areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date Pickers</li>
<li>Currency</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, the locale setting will decide the primary language and reigon for your site. For example, selecting French will ensure all dates represented on the site are in French. If you select <strong>Detect Automatically</strong> your site will attempt to guess the user's locale based on their browser settings.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note:</span> If your language or country is not displayed here, we add locality settings by request, get in touch with us and we can add them for you.<br /><br /></p>
