<p>By default detail error reporting is turned on. If somehow this feature is turned off, when there is a problem in a page, a friendly error message will be displayed. If you are developing it is helpful to see detailed error information which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues.</p>
<p>To ensure the friendly error messages are not displayed, open the config file (config/config.php) and locate the property <strong>SHOW_FRIENDLY_ERRORS</strong> and set this to &lsquo;false&rsquo;.</p>
<pre class="brush:php">$CONFIG['SHOW_FRIENDLY_ERRORS'] = false;</pre><p>When development has ended, it is advised you enable friendly errors again to prevent users from seeing information about your site.</p>
<h3>Alternative Error Tracking</h3>
<p>Most site errors are also available in other locations. On the file system you can find a log file (logs/error.txt) which contains recent errors. They are also stored in the database and can be accessed via the admin area by selecting Settings \&gt; Error Log.</p>
<h3>Modifying the friendly error page</h3>
<p>If you wish to customise the friendly error page, you can do this by modifying the HTML file located under /modules/cms/error_pages/error.htm</p>
